/* Composite Pattern 
The Composite pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. 
It enables you to create hierarchical structures where each element can be treated as a single object or a collection of objects. 
The pattern uses a common interface to represent both individual objects (leaf nodes) and compositions (composite nodes), 
allowing clients to interact with them uniformly.
